.SH NAME
\*plist \- produce C source listing from \*N object file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*plist
.B [ \-V ]
.RB [ \-h ]
source-file
.B . \|. \|.
[object-file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*plist
command
produces a C source listing with line number information attached.
If multiple C source files were used to create the object file,
.I \*plist
will accept multiple file names. 
The object file is taken to be the last non-C source
file argument.
If no object file is specified the default object file,
.B \*pa.out\c
\&,
will be used.
.PP
Line numbers will be printed for each breakpoint
inserted by the compiler (generally, each executable C statement
that begins a new line of source).
Line numbering begins anew for each function.
Line number 1 is always the line containing the left curly brace
.RB (\| { \|)
that
begins the function body.
Line numbers will also be supplied for inner block
redeclarations of local variables so that they can be distinguished
by the symbolic debugger.
.PP
The
.B \-V
flag will supply version information of the
.I \*plist
command.
.PP
The
.B \-h
flag will suppress heading output.
.SH "WARNINGS"
Object files given to
.I \*plist
must have symbolic debugging symbols.
.PP
Since
.I \*plist
does not use the C preprocessor,
it may be unable to recognize function definitions whose
syntax has been distorted by the use of C preprocessor macro substitutions.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"

.I name
cannot be read.
