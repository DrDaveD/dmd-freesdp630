This 630 MTG software development package works on both Suns and System V.
First install the pseudo-tty based layers into your chosen directory.  You
can then install this package on top of it into the same target directory
or in a different directory (it works easier if they're together).  If you
plan to use xcip, xproof, or some other tools that need troff fonts, you
will also want to install the lib/xfont files from the tc630 package into
$DMD/font.

To compile and install this package, use

	make DMD=<your chosen install directory> install

To make the default DMD be something other than the directory you are
installing in, add "DEFDMD=<default DMD>" to the make command.
For example, do something like
	make DMD=/usr/local/630.new DEFDMD=/usr/local/630 install
and copy /usr/local/630.new to /usr/local/630 when you're ready.

If layers is installed in a different directory than this package, you must
also specify the "DMDSYS" make variable to point to that directory.
