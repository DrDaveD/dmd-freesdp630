These files are part of the 630 software development package to provide
    minimal functionality to users of 5620s without requiring the users to
    have the 5620 software development package.

lsys.8;7;3 in this directory is the "patch" file to make a 5620 with 1.1 roms
    behave like one with 2.0 roms.  
set_enc.j is a short initial patch file that makes a 1.1 5620 understand
    encoding mode.
The source for both of these files has been lost.
The byte order of the COFF files needs to be reversed for little endian hosts.
    It's ok to use mc68conv instead of m32conv; they both recognize the
    bellmac-32 COFF file magic number.
